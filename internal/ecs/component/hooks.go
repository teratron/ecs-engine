// component lifecycle event. It is intentionally an empty interface: the
// concrete type (`*world.DeferredWorld`, T-1C02) is not yet defined and
// cannot be imported here without creating an import cycle. Hook authors
// should type-assert `ctx` to the concrete world type at call time.

// Forward declaration only — the World package will publish a richer
// interface once available; this type is a placeholder that keeps the hook
// signatures stable.

// Hooks are invoked by the World during structural modification (Insert,
// Remove, Replace). They observe state but should perform structural changes
// only via the deferred-world contract supplied through ctx — direct world
// mutation from inside a hook is undefined behaviour.
