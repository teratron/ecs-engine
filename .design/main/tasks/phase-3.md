# Stage 3 Tasks — Assets, Math & Concurrency

**Phase:** 3
**Status:** Todo
**Strategic Goal:** Final foundation phase before the STOP FACTOR gate. After Phase 3 the upper render/physics/network stack can be unblocked.

## High-Level Checklist

- [ ] [T-3A] Task pool: worker pools, scoped tasks, parallel iteration (work-stealing). ([l1-task-system.md](../specifications/l1-task-system.md))
- [ ] [T-3B] Asset server: loaders, handles, hot-reload, IO abstraction. ([l1-asset-system.md](../specifications/l1-asset-system.md))
- [ ] [T-3C] Scene system: serialization, dynamic scenes, entity remapping. ([l1-scene-system.md](../specifications/l1-scene-system.md))
- [ ] [T-3D] Math: vectors, matrices, quaternions, colors, geometric primitives, `simd/archsimd` accel. ([l1-math-system.md](../specifications/l1-math-system.md))
- [ ] [T-3T] Validation: parallel-iter determinism (deterministic seed), asset hot-reload roundtrip, scene save/load fixture, math correctness vs. reference impl.

## Atomic Decomposition

> Pending. Run `/magic.task main "decompose phase-3"` once Phase 2 ≥ 50% Done.

## Notes

- L2 Go specs for math/asset/scene/task are **not yet drafted**. Either author them mid-Phase 3 or implement directly from L1 (acceptable for this layer if no architectural risk surfaces).
- Phase 3 is the **last** Bootstrap phase that runs without the C29 unblock. Phases 4+ require POC validation.
